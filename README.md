<h2>Code</h2>

All code refering to template is in <b>./Views/MainWindow.axaml</b>
This project is using MVVM concept. Actions are binding to controls.

<h3>Button action binding</h3>

here <code>Command</code> indicate what function to use when button clicked
here <code>CommandParameter</code> let us pass an argument to the previous function (We're passing the mainwindow element needed to execute some actions)

```xaml
 <Button 
    Grid.Row="0" 
    Grid.Column="1" 
    Command="{Binding CreateRepo}" 
    CommandParameter="{Binding ElementName=MainWindow}"
>Create</Button>
```

<h3>Text field binding</h3>
Here <code>Text</code> attribute is binded to a property from the ViewModel 

```xaml
<TextBox Margin="10,0"  Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="0" Name="repoName" Text="{Binding RepoName, Mode=TwoWay}"></TextBox>
```

<h3>Functions of ViewModel</h3>
All code refering to the functions triggered when clicking on buttons are in <b>./ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs</b>

<h3>Getters/Setters</h3>
For text field getters and setters are defined

```csharp
private string _repoName = @"default";
public string RepoName
{
    get => _repoName;
    set {
        _repoName = value;
    }
}
```

<h3>Functions</h3>

```csharp

//Change folder selected for commit actions. window passed from button binding parameter is used to open file explorer from system
public async void SelectRepo(Window window) {}

// generic function to handle file explorer opening and execute a callback after folder selected
public async void folderOpener(Window window, string title, Action<string, string> callback, string command) {}

// generic function to handle file explorer opening and execute a callback after files are selected
public async void fileOpener(Window window, string title, Action<string, string> callback, string command) {}

// Set & Execute bash commands
private void bashExec(string path, string cmd) {}

//wrappers for button actions
public void CreateRepo(Window window) {
    folderOpener(window,"SÃ©lectionner une destination", bashExec, $"mkdir {RepoName} && cd {RepoName} && git init");
}

// same as previous wrapper execpt handle no file selected with dialog error box
public void AddFilesToRepo(Window window) {}
```
